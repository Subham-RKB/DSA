What is Data Structure?
    -is a way in which data is stored on a computers.

Why do we need DS ?
    - Each DS allows data to be stored in specific manner.
    - Data Structure allows efficient data search and retrieval.
    - Specific Data structures are decided to work for specific problems.
    - It allows to manage large amount of data such as large databases and indexing services such as hash table.

Abstract Data Tyes(ADT):
    - Entities that are definations of data and operations but do not have implementation details.
    
//Graph Theory unacademy - (Sonia Motwani)
A graph is a non-linear data structure consistiing of nodes and edges. The npdes are smetimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any 
two nodes.
Connected Graph
Regular Graph = All node has same degree
Complete Graph = Every node is connected to all others nodes.
Cycle Graph = A graph in which the graph is a cycle in itself
the degree of each vertex is 2.
Cyclic Graph.

Every complete graph is regular.
